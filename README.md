## 🌟 What AURA Can Do

* 🗣️ **Talk to Me!** Uses your microphone to understand commands and speaks responses.
* ⏰ **Time-Sensitive Greetings:** Starts the conversation with a cheerful "Good Morning," "Good Afternoon," or "Good Evening."
* 🔗 **Web Navigator:** Just ask, and AURA can open your favorite websites like Google, YouTube, GitHub, and your personal Portfolio.
* 📅 **Time Keeper:** Need to know the current time or today's date? AURA's got you covered.
* ❓ **Your Go-To for Answers:** If AURA doesn't recognize a specific command, it cleverly uses Google Search to find the information you're looking for.
* 📱 **Looks Good Everywhere:** Designed to adapt to different screen sizes, so AURA is just as helpful on your phone as on your laptop.
